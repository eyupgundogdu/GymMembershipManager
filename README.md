# Gym Membership Management System (Python CLI)

A robust command-line application designed to automate gym membership tracking, duration management, and member categorization using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Key Features

- Member Registration: Add members with specific membership types (Gold, Silver, Basic) and initial durations.
- Daily Workout Simulation: A unique feature that simulates a day passing, decrementing the membership days of all members simultaneously.
- Expiration Tracking: Automated alerts when a member's duration hits zero, preventing further gym access.
- Membership Renewal: Search for specific members and extend their membership duration.
- Priority Filtering: Quickly list high-tier (Gold) members for specialized management.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Global List Updates: Implementing logic that affects all objects within a data structure.
- Conditional Logic: Managing boundary conditions to ensure membership days do not drop below zero.
- Input Validation: Using case-insensitive string matching to ensure a smooth user experience.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the source code.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Run the following command:
